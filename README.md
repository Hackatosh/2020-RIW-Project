# Information Retrieval Project 2020

Welcome to the repository of our Information Retrieval project !

The project was initiated as an academic project at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/)
during the Information Retrieval and Web Search course.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before being able to run this project, you need to fulfill the following
requirements:

* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/)

The project also uses the Python packages `numpy` and `gensim`.

### Use the Search Engine
Use `python` or `python3` depending on your python setup.


```shell
python main.py

This will display all possible options, add `-h` to get a more detailed help.


## The Stanford C276 collection

The collection used for this project is the public collection made available for the course
"CS 276 / LING 286: Information Retrieval and Web Search" from Stanford University.
It is a collection of web pages from the Stanford University website.
The webpages in the collection are not raw HTML : they are already tokenized, which makes it easier to work with them.

The collection can be downloaded at the following address : http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs276/pa/pa1-data.zip.

## Built With
The whole project is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).
